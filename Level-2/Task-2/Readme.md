# Task 2 - Job Board Website

This is my **second task (Level 2)** for the **CodSoft Web Development Internship**.

## Project Description

I created a **Job Board Website** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The website allows users to explore job listings, view job details, and apply through a basic form. It features a clean layout, navigation, and a simple search function.

Features include:

- Home page with welcome message
- Job listings with company and location info
- Job detail page with description and application form
- Search functionality using JavaScript
- Responsive design
